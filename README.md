ðŸŽ¬ **Pixar Movies â€” Power BI Dashboard Project**
I recently completed an exciting data visualization project exploring the world of Pixar films using Power BI! This project combines storytelling with analytics â€” exactly what Pixar is all about.

Hereâ€™s what I uncovered:

âœ… **Revenue Trends by Decade**
Analyzed global box office earnings across four decades. The 2011â€“2020 period stood out, generating a massive **\$7.83B**, which is **517.74% higher** than the 1990â€“2000 decade â€” the lowest performer with \$1.26B.

âœ… **Highest Grossing Film**
Identified **Inside Out 2** as the highest-grossing Pixar movie globally.

âœ… **Budget and ROI Analysis**
Compared total global revenue (\$17.04B) against overall production budget (\$4.55B), resulting in a solid **Return on Investment (ROI) of 374.48%** across Pixarâ€™s film portfolio.

âœ… **Film Ratings Breakdown**
Out of all Pixar films, **PG-rated movies** made up **53.57%**, indicating a slight tilt toward slightly more mature themes while still staying family-friendly.
G-rated films: 13
PG-rated films: 15

âœ… **Genre and Runtime Exploration**
Displayed genre distribution across Pixar films using stacked bar visuals.
Also highlighted the **Top 5 longest films** by runtime â€” *Incredibles 2* leads at 118 minutes.

âœ… **Awards & Recognition**
Mapped out award types and statuses (Won, Nominated, Ineligible) from the Academy dataset

âœ… **Dynamic Filtering & Visual Elements**
Included interactive filtering by film title, automated image display (movie posters), plot summaries, and visual summaries for cast count by role.

This project helped me strengthen my DAX skills, data modeling techniques, and visual storytelling â€” all while diving into the magical world of Pixar! âœ¨
